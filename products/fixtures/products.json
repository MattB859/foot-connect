This pair of sneakers comes with a colour palette bordering on retro vibes, with a vibrant combination of red, green, blue, grey, and orange, as well as an elegant black panelling that helps the other colours to stand out. The textured and layered appearance of this versatile sneaker is also made more interesting by the inclusion of glossy black leather as well as the coloured panels. The Nike swoosh stands out prominently in white against the rainbow of colours, and this works to match the white outer sole, which is cushioned for maximum comfort. Black laces work cohesively to run into the black leather panels, and the grey tongue adds a contrast at the top of the Womens Air Jordan 1 Mid Multi Patent.",

The sneakers are perfectly mismatched, complete opposites of each other, but somehow it absolutely works. The left comes in a palette of greens and blues, whilst the right is composed of reds and oranges mostly. We see watch faces feature across the shoe's laces whilst graffiti working features around the outsole of each shoe. That same outsole houses the legendary Nike Air technology to guarantee unparalleled comfort wear after wear. This sneaker absolutely flew from the shelves the first time around and has been somewhat of a grail for many since. Don't make the same mistake twice; add this sneaker to your collection toda",
