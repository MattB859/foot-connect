## Bugs found and fixed

</details>


- ### The Bug in this code was causing shoe sizes not to display.

```
 {% if item.product.has_sizes %}

```
- ### I overcome the issue by adding further conditions

```
 {% if item.product.has_sizes or item.product.shoe_sizes %} 
```

- ### The bug in this code was causing carousel img width to be over stretched and unresponsive

```
.carousel-cell { 
width: 20%;
margin-right:10px; 
background: none;
border-radius: 5px;
counter-increment: carousel-cell;
}
```
- ### In this new code I simply changed the width with a 290px.

```
.carousel-cell { 
width: 290px;
margin-right:10px; 
background: none;
border-radius: 5px;
counter-increment: carousel-cell;
}
```

The quantity-form has been used twice, and hides one or the other depending on the screen size However, as the quantity-form uses an ID to identify itself, only the first element within the HTML with that ID is picked up by the corresponding code.

- ### In this new code I simply changed the ID on the quantity-form to a class.

- ### Error Bug
```
// Disable +/- buttons outside 1-99 range
    function handleEnableDisable(itemId) {
        var currentValue = parseInt($(`#id_qty_${itemId}`).val());
        var minusDisabled = currentValue < 2;
        var plusDisabled = currentValue > 98;
        $(`#decrement-qty_${itemId}`).prop('disabled', minusDisabled);
        $(`#increment-qty_${itemId}`).prop('disabled', plusDisabled);
    }
```
